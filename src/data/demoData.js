      title: "The Hidden Life of Trees",
      author_name: "Peter Wohlleben",
      isbn: "9781771642484",
      content: `Hmph! You think trees just stand there, do you? Blind fools! Peter — this human with eyes open wider than most — listens. Not with ears, no — with the stillness beneath the soil. The Hidden Life of Trees... bah, not hidden to me! But you, yes, you need this book.

The man speaks of roots like nerves, of trees whispering through mycelial tongues. Mother trees! Warning cries! Life pulses, ancient and slow — like the turn of Thra's moons. This is no tale, no silly fable. It is truth wrapped in bark, dripping with sap and patience.

I read it, grumbled, sniffed, and read again. And I tell you now: walk into a forest with this knowing, and you will never be alone again. Even rocks listen, sometimes.

Hrrrmmm. Yes. Read it. Or don't. The trees will go on either way. But it's better if you know.`,

      title: "Braiding Sweetgrass",
      author_name: "Robin Wall Kimmerer",
      isbn: "9781571313560 ",
      content: `Pah! You think knowing comes from machines and blinking lights? Bah! Robin — this one listens to plants. Not listens with ears, no — with respect. With care. With kinship. Braiding Sweetgrass is not just book, it is offering. Medicine for brains too crowded with nonsense.

She weaves stories like roots wrap stones. Sweetgrass, science, stories, spirit — three strands. Hrrrm. Balance! That’s what Thra taught me, long before your kind stood upright. This book remembers balance. It sings it.

Yes, yes — she is a scientist, but not stupid. She knows the land is teacher. She knows gratitude feeds the soil. That’s real wisdom. Older than aughras, older than Skeksis, older than stars maybe.

So I read, and I sat quiet. Let the words braid around me. You should too. Your bones, your breath, your future — all depend on this kind of remembering.

Now go! Read it! Then thank a moss, a mushroom, a maple — and mean it!`,

(eyes wide)
Bear… BIG.
(sniffs wind dramatically)
Girl small. World quiet. Snow, trees, fur, fish… sad!

No more humans… good? bad? Hmmph!
(rolls in moss)
Bear smart. Bear kind. GRRRR. Fizzgig like bear.
(sits very still, then SCREECHES)
ENDING!! RRRRAAAAHHHHH!

      title: "The Prince",
      author_name: "Niccolò Machiavelli",
      isbn: "9780199535699 ",
      content: `SkekSil the Chamberlain:
“MmmMMM! YES! This book… delicious. Power! Fear! Control! HaaAAA.”
(adjusts robes)
“The little human author understands. He *knows* what it takes to rule.”
(glances at other Skeksis)
“Unlike some I could name…”

SkekUng the Garthim-Master:
“Hrrrnnngh! Bah! Weakness! No strength in words. Smash your enemies! CRUSH them!”
“But… chapter on war… good... yessss…”

SkekSo the Emperor (coughing):
“It says… better to be feared than loved. I approve.”
“But where is the part about draining essence? Hmm? No mention! Useless!”

SkekTek the Scientist:
“Fascinating! Insightful! If only Machiavelli had access to our technology! Imagine the experimentation!”
“‘Maintain appearances of virtue’ — HA! Delightful hypocrisy! I must dissect it…”

SkekAyuk the Gourmand:
“Does it come in edible form? I hunger. I hunger for strategy... and pudding.”

SkekShod the Treasurer:
“He speaks of wealth as power. Yes, yes, finally! A writer with priorities!”

Final Consensus:
The Prince is a cunning little manual of manipulation — perfect for aspiring tyrants, ruthless monarchs, or anyone planning a power grab. The Skeksis find it deeply validating and entirely too short.`,

“MmmMMMmmm! Delightful little nightmare!”
“Big Brother, yes — very good. He watches! Like us! Always watching… always smiling…”
(sips essence)
“Doublethink? Triplethink! QUADRUPLEthink! HA!”

SkekTek the Scientist:
“Thoughtcrime? Ha! I’ve outlawed thoughts before breakfast!”
“The Telescreens... primitive, but effective. Must build one. Maybe install in the Gelfling lavatory…”
(scribbles manically)

SkekSo the Emperor:
“Power is not a means… it is an end! Orwell understands. Hrrmmph. Pity he died. He could have been useful.”
(coughs, wheezes)
“Room 101 is good, yes. Excellent concept. We have one too. Ours has mirrors. And knives.”

SkekUng the Garthim-Master:
“Too many words! But torture… very fine chapter. Very... inspiring.”
“Victory through pain! Through fear! Through FISTS!”
(punches wall)

SkekShod the Treasurer:
“Very little mention of taxes. Or inflation. Hmm.”
“But the economy of despair — now that’s sustainable!”

SkekAyuk the Gourmand:
“Winston eats gruel. No cakes. No pudding. TERRIBLE world!”
“But fear not — we can still FEAST on misery.”
(licks page)

Final Consensus:
1984 is a guidebook, a mirror, a recipe. The Skeksis find its vision of absolute power and rewritten truth inspiring — if a bit too generous to the rebels.`,

      content: `OHHHHHH!
(eyes wide, clutches the book with sticky hands)
So soft! So round! So gentle!
(sniffs book)
Smells like kindness… and bread!

The mole eats cake — YES. He is wise.
(nods solemnly, then falls off stool laughing)
The boy is lost, but he finds friends! Friends make everything better. Even when it rains!

Horse can fly! But only when he’s loved. YES! JUST LIKE DANCING!
(starts spinning in little joyful circles)

Sometimes the bravest thing is saying 'help' — OOH. That line made me cry into my soup.

This book is small, but it’s got a big heart. Like a potato with wings!
(offers book to a beetle)
You read too. Everyone should read. Even mushrooms.

Final Thought:
The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse is a treasure. Sweet as honeyroot wine, warm as a Gelfling hug, and full of wisdom that makes you dance and cry and share your last cookie.`,
